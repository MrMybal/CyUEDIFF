# Stored animation source tracks

No Unreal process or redistributed engine files are needed.

## Bounded raw animation key arrays - 0.108

Loose tagged RawAnimSequenceTrack values now decode the UE5 Release 39–51 bulk serializer for verified UE4 522 / UE5 1004 or 1013 profiles. Three element-size/count-prefixed float arrays retain position, quaternion XYZW and scale keys. Scalar work shares the property reader budget; wrong strides, counts, non-finite components, truncation and unknown profiles roll back the whole property to opaque bytes. Older custom versions retain tagged member decoding. Tests cover both file profiles, custom-version boundaries, atomic rollback, aggregate limits and cancellation. Engine source was consulted locally; no engine code or assets are included.
